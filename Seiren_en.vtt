00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.460
In this heart of mine

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.740
There's no place left to run

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.860
Turning to face you...

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.020
I start rurning back

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.660
To that loving place

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.540
Again and again

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.860
That first moment I saw you

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.020
It seemd like slow-motion

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.380
Into my mind came that image of you

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.860
Your smiling profile peaking through your hair

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.020
Our classroom is filled with people's voices.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.860
In an instant I can find yours.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.860
Whenever we meet, I fall in love with you

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.700
I want to hold your delicate hands in mine

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.060
Your voice glistens

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.420
in the wind like a flower

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.380
Fragile, but...

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.180
shinning brilliantly

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.460
Always...Forever...

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.580
Hold firmly onto my hand
